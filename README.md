Python will be introduced and used primarily via the IPython (or Jupyter) Notebooks, and will cover the Numpy, Scipy, MatPlotlib, Pandas, 
Seaborn, and scikit_learn Python modules. These capabilities will be demonstrated through simple data science tasks such as obtaining data, 
cleaning data, visualizing data, and basic data analysis. Topics will include:
(1)General Linear Models
(2)Supervised Machine Learning
(3)Tree Algorithms and Ensemble Techniques
(4)Unsupervised Machine Learning
(5)Practical Machine Learning
(6)Text Analysis
(7)Social Media Analysis
(8)Natural Language Processing
(9)Network Analysis
(10)Probabilistic Programming
(11)Cloud Computing
(12)NoSQL DataStores
(13)Spark
(14)Deep Learning
