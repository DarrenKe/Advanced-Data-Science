For this project, I would use Python, primarily via the IPython (or Jupyter) Notebooks to explore different topics in data science. Numpy, Scipy, MatPlotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and scikit_learn Python modules will be applied throughout the whole project. These capabilities will be demonstrated through simple data science tasks such as obtaining data, 
cleaning data, visualizing data, and basic data analysis. Topics will include:
(1)General Linear Models
(2)Supervised Machine Learning
(3)Tree Algorithms and Ensemble Techniques
(4)Unsupervised Machine Learning
(5)Practical Machine Learning
(6)Text Analysis
(7)Social Media Analysis
(8)Natural Language Processing
(9)Network Analysis
(10)Probabilistic Programming
(11)Cloud Computing
(12)NoSQL DataStores
(13)Spark
(14)Deep Learning.
